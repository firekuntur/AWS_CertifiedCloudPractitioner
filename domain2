# 🛡 Domain 2 — Security & Compliance Glossary

---

## 🔐 1. AWS Root User & IAM Basics

### **Root User**
The original account owner with full unrestricted access.  
Should only be used for:
- Account closure
- Changing payment info
- Managing Support Plans
- Restoring MFA
- Very specific account-level tasks

### **Root User Best Practices**
- Enable MFA  
- Never use for daily operations  
- Lock away access keys  

---

### **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
Service for managing **authentication** (who can log in) and **authorization** (what they can do).  
Free service.

---

## 🔑 2. IAM Identities (Users, Groups, Roles, Policies)

### **IAM User**
Represents a human or application needing long-term access.  
Can have passwords or access keys.

### **IAM Group**
A collection of users that share permissions.  
Best practice:  
Assign policies to **groups**, not individual users.

### **IAM Role**
Temporary access credentials that can be **assumed** by:
- AWS services (EC2 → S3)
- Applications
- Other AWS accounts
- Federated users

Roles **do not** have passwords or long-term keys.

### **IAM Policy**
JSON document defining allowed/denied actions.  
Attached to users, groups, or roles.

#### **Explicit Deny**
Always overrides any Allow.  
Important exam rule.

---

### **IAM Access Keys**
Used by CLI/SDK.  
Should be:
- Rotated regularly  
- Never stored in code  
- Only used when roles cannot be used  

---

### **IAM Password Policy**
Allows enforcing:
- Length  
- Rotation  
- Reuse prevention  
- Complexity  

---

### **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
Adds a second verification factor.  
Mandatory for root user.

---

## 🛡 3. Network Protection (Security Groups vs NACLs)

### **Security Group (SG)**
- Instance-level firewall  
- **Stateful**  
- Allows ONLY **allow** rules  
- Automatically allows return traffic  
- Applied to ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)

Best choice for:
- Restricting EC2 inbound/outbound  
- Controlling ALB traffic

---

### **Network ACL (NACL)**
- Subnet-level firewall  
- **Stateless**  
- Supports **allow and deny** rules  
- Evaluated before Security Groups  
- Good for blocking IPs or ports at subnet level

Exam tip:  
If question says “stateless,” answer = **NACL**

---

## 📜 4. Logging, Auditing, and Monitoring

### **AWS CloudTrail**
Logs all API calls and console actions.  
Records:
- Who made the call  
- When  
- From where  
- What actions were taken  

Used for:
- Auditing  
- Compliance  
- Security investigations  

---

### **AWS Config**
Tracks configuration changes of AWS resources.  
Maintains **configuration history** and allows **compliance checks**.

Used for:
- Detecting non-compliant changes  
- Tracking resource drift  
- Governance  

---

### **CloudWatch**
Monitors performance metrics (CPU, memory, logs).  
**NOT** an auditing tool.  
(Exam often tries to confuse this with CloudTrail.)

---

## 🧩 5. Threat Detection & Vulnerability Scanning

### **GuardDuty**
Threat detection service powered by ML.  
Finds:
- Malicious IP connections  
- Anomalous logins  
- Reconnaissance activity  
- Compromised IAM credentials  
- EC2 compromise indicators  

Clue:  
If question says **“detect threats automatically"** → GuardDuty.

---

### **Amazon Inspector**
Automated vulnerability scanner for:
- EC2 instances
- Amazon ECR container images
- Lambda functions

Detects:
- CVEs  
- Security best practice violations  

---

### **Amazon Macie**
ML-based discovery of **PII** in Amazon S3.  
Looks for:
- Names  
- Addresses  
- Credit card numbers  
- Personal identifiers  

Exam clue:  
“PII” = **Macie**

---

### **IAM Access Analyzer**
Identifies resources such as:
- S3 buckets  
- KMS keys  
- IAM roles  

…that are shared:
- Publicly  
- With other AWS accounts  
- With external identities  

---

## 🔐 6. Encryption Essentials

### **Encryption At Rest**
Data is encrypted when stored on disk.  
Used in:
- S3  
- EBS  
- RDS  
- DynamoDB  
- Lambda environment vars  

Managed by AWS or customer depending on key type.

---

### **Encryption In Transit**
Data encrypted while traveling over network (TLS/SSL).

---

### **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**
Manages encryption keys.  
Supports:
- AWS-managed keys  
- Customer-managed keys (CMK)  
- Grants fine-grained control via IAM

Used heavily throughout AWS.

---

### **S3 Encryption Types**
- **SSE-S3** (AWS manages keys)  
- **SSE-KMS** (Customer-managed keys in KMS)  
- **SSE-C** (Customer-supplied keys)  

---

## 🧱 7. Application & Network Protection

### **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
Protects:
- CloudFront  
- ALB  
- API Gateway  
- AppSync  

Blocks:
- SQL injection  
- XSS  
- Common web attacks  

---

### **AWS Shield**
DDoS protection.  
Two tiers:
- **Shield Standard (free)**  
- **Shield Advanced (paid)** for enterprise protection

Protects:
- CloudFront  
- Route 53  
- ALBs/NLBs  
- Global Accelerator  

---

### **AWS Secrets Manager**
Manages secrets like:
- API keys  
- DB credentials  
- Tokens  

Supports automatic rotation.

---

### **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**
Stores configuration values and secrets.

---

## 🏢 8. AWS Organizations & Compliance

### **AWS Organizations**
Manages multiple AWS accounts from a central location.  
Features:
- Consolidated billing  
- Central policy control  
- Automated account creation  

---

### **Service Control Policy (SCP)**
Defines **maximum permissions** allowed in organization accounts.  
Applies to:
- All IAM users  
- All IAM roles  
- Even the root user in child accounts  

Example:  
“Prevent anyone from deleting S3 buckets” → Implement via SCP.

---

### **AWS Artifact**
Portal for retrieving compliance reports:
- SOC  
- PCI  
- ISO  
- HIPAA  
- FedRAMP

Useful for audits.

---

### **Shared Responsibility Model**
Defines who is responsible for what.

#### AWS Responsible For (Security **of** the cloud):
- Hardware  
- Infrastructure  
- Hypervisor  
- Data centers  
- Managed service infrastructure  

#### Customer Responsible For (Security **in** the cloud):
- IAM policies  
- SGs/NACLs  
- Encryption choices  
- Patching EC2  
- Data classification  
- Application code  

---

# 🧠 9. Misc Key Terms That Appear on the Exam

### **Least Privilege**
Give users the minimum permissions they need.

### **Defense in Depth**
Use multiple layers of security (IAM + SG + NACL + WAF + KMS).

### **Compliance**
AWS shares reports via AWS Artifact.

### **Penetration Testing**
Allowed for certain AWS services (must follow AWS rules of engagement).
